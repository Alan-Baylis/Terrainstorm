# Terrainstorm
Easy procedural map generation in Unity3d using [libmapgen](https://github.com/tmsbrg/libmapgen)

A WIP Unity3d library that uses libmapgen to generate maps easily. Add the files to your project in a subfolder, and add the MapGenerator script to a GameObject in Unity. Then add generators and passes to create a Ruleset.
