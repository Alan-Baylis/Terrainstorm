# Terrainstorm

Edit: This project was part of libmapgen, it never got really far, and I stopped working on it. I now work on OpenRA map generation instead. This repository is left as an archive. See also [libmapgen's readme](https://github.com/tmsbrg/libmapgen/blob/master/README.md).

Easy procedural map generation in Unity3d using [libmapgen](https://github.com/tmsbrg/libmapgen)

A WIP Unity3d library that uses libmapgen to generate maps easily. Add the files to your project in a subfolder, and add the MapGenerator script to a GameObject in Unity. Then add generators and passes to create a Ruleset.
